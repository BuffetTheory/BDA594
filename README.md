Question: What is big data?

Answer: Big data, in my opinion, is data that is so large is requires its own database or cloud system, and can range from anywhere greater that 1mil lines of data (maximum that Excel can hold) to infinity. Big data allows us to gain insights, with statistical significance, and typically requires the use of machine learning algorithms to help us interpret the data.
